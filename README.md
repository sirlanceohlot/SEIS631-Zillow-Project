# Real Estate Investment Project

A real estate investor who would like to invest $7.5M dollars in the real estate market. 

They are interested in single family homes or rental apartments unless we recommend other types of real estate which may return maximum profits. 

Their interest is to buy properties, do the upgrades and then rent the properties, however they are also interested in blooming markets where if needed, they can sell the properties quickly.  

We are tasked with providing our real estate investor with what part of the United States they should invest in to receive maximum gains. 

We will also provide our investor with market trends,sale and inventory listing pricing, sqft price of homes, sale and listing ratios, how long properties are on the market before they rent or sell, the average profits they can expect on their properties after paying their mortgage for rentals and whether they should invest now or wait.

Our Team of analysts has selected a tri-state region in the middle of the eastern part of the United States for our analysis, the markets we have selected are Kentucky, North Carolina & Tennessee. 

The analysis is broken out into sections for each state within the tri-state region with a summarization at the bottom with our recommendations.
